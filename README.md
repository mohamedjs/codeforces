## üöÄ How to Use

### Python Solutions
1. Open a terminal in the `codeforces/problems/` directory.
2. Run a solution with:
   ```bash
   python3 ProblemName.py
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   python3 Anton_and_Danik.py
   ```

### C++ Solutions
1. Compile the C++ file:
   ```bash
   g++ ProblemName.cpp -o ProblemName
   ```
2. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./ProblemName
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   g++ Bear_and_Big_Brother.cpp -o Bear_and_Big_Brother
   ./Bear_and_Big_Brother
   ```

### TypeScript Solutions
1. Navigate to the `problems-with-ts/` directory.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
